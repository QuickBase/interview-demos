Our Python Engineers are want to deploy their Python3 service. 

The engineering team is well-versed in Python but they are struggling with how to deploy the right SDLC (software development lifecycle). This team has reached out to you as a member of one of our platform teams to discuss how you would approach this problem and have also provided you some requirements over email.

## These are the highlights of their email:

"We are not planning on making any changes to our Git repository structure or our branching patterns. Currently, all GitHub pull requests are merged from separate development branches into a 'main' branch at integration time."

“Our current server also passes through API calls through to other systems. This impacts how we develop locally and might be an opportunity to introduce new infrastructure as we split up the server”

## Demonstration

Given the team's requirements as listed here, please be prepared to discuss the following points with your interview team:

* For each requirement and the information provided, are there any other questions you feel you need to clarify with the team about their projects? 
* With the information you know about these requirements and any additional answers provided by the interview team, how would you either change the existing systems or create new solutions to solve each problem?
* For each requirement listed, how will you measure the success of the changes you have suggested to meet the needs of that specific requirement? For example, if you suggest a totally new source control system (not recommended), how will you measure the value provided by this change over time?
* Are there are any other new requirements you would suggest to the team that they may not have considered in order to best meet the goals of the project as described?
* What kind of monitoring would you recommend the team put into place? 


** While this is mostly a conversation, and some candidates may want to draw diagrams during the call, some candidates might find it helpful to have some pre-made diagrams. Either option is perfectly acceptable to us. **
