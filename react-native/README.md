# React Native Craft demo
One of our Quick Base partners has asked us to create a feature inside our react-native application. 
After an internal review, we have found a significant portion of our user base that could benefit from ttheir feature. 
You have been given the opportunity to create a proof of concept. 

## User story
Sally's garage manages a high volume of inventory for many independent auto mechanics using a Quick Base application. 
Sally is hoping to use a native iOS application to add new models to their inventory tracking Quick Base app. 

## Technical Requirements

1. Use react-native
1. Use a web view that wraps our current mobile web experience
1. Create a native view that pushes data to the Quick Base API

## Stretch Goals
* Sally is hoping to be able to scan a barcode using our native application and have that data pushed into the "Barcode" 
field in their Quick Base application. The mobile app should allow one of the floor managers to view the provided add 
new record web page, and upon clicking the "Barcode" field, there should be a barcode scanner (fine to use QR codes 
for testing) that scans and then returns that data to the add new record view.
