Quickbase Web Systems Front End Craft Demo
General Description
The purpose of the craft demo is to give us a jumping off point for discussion of your approach to solving a problem and of your code. We are interested in learning how you approach this problem and go about solving it.

We expect this project to take experienced developers familiar with web technologies (HTML, CSS, javascript) about 2-3 hours to complete. We know not everyone has unlimited time to work on interview projects and we do not expect that everyone completes all of the requirements. However, you may be asked how you might have solved a requirement you didn't get to if you had more time. By the same token if you want to extend the requirements (e.g., adding more extensive user input validation), please feel free to do so as you see fit. Generally, we prefer higher code quality over more features for the purpose of the demo if you start to run out of time.

Use of your favorite libraries or frameworks is welcomed but optional. The requirements outlined below can be completed with or without a framework. We like using frameworks to help us deliver customer value faster, but be careful that you can still demonstrate your coding ability. For example, you might want to hand-code one of the validations on the form even if the framework already provides it.

Your demo should run on whichever web browser you prefer.

Candidate Exercise Presentation Outline
We have created a PowerPoint template which covers an outline of what we would like to talk about during the first section of your interview before you share your craft demo. Feel free to use the template provided or make your own. For developers, we are more interested in your code than your PowerPoint skills, so plan your prep time accordingly.

When you show off your craft demo, we will ask you to show us how it works from a user's perspective (e.g., filling out the form and clicking "save"). After that, we will ask for a tour of your code with a focus on how you got the core functionality to work.

#The scenario#
You are building out a component to display a list of cards based on a dataset provided as `json`. The designer has provided you with a desktop design and a mobile design, and a base HTML structure for the cards based upon how they are used on other parts of the site. 

#Design#
A User Experience (UX) designer has created the following image and requirements for the component you are building. It is a first draft. We are collaborative here at Quickbase and as a developer you can suggest alternatives to the items below. We often have conversations between developers and UX designers about a spec before we go build it. Unfortunately, in this setup scenario, you can't talk with the UX designer so feel free to imagine you had the conversation and make changes you think would be worthwhile.

#Your Approach#
You can use any technologies or libraries you'd like, but we'd like you to focus on core requirements below. When you are satisfied with that, if you have time left, there are some stretch goals. Remember the key to this exercise is to build somethign that looks as close to the provided mockups as possible and pulls the data in from the dataset provided.
